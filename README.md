# Roisin's Front End challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Testing
I wrote tests for all 3 React Components in the app with Jest and React-testing-library, all passing.

## Accessibility
The app passes the WAVE accessibility evaluation after minor tweaking

## Responsive design
The app is responsive, though it could be improved, particularly making the height responsive.

## Fun Additions 
I enjoyed playing around with the design and added card company logos that highlight which card you are using by checking the first digit of the card number.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this project, and I appreciated the opportunity to practice writing more tests
